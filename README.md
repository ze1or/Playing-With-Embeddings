# Playing-With-Embeddings

this notebook is the solution of an exercise from the machine learning course of my university in witch i perform dimensionality reductions on the scikit learn's dataset called digits, the MNIST dataset and then play with some peculiar and toy dataset.

the reader is expected to be familiar with working with files and some embedding tecniques.
